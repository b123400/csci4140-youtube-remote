	 * The sprite sheet loader is used to load in JSON sprite sheet data
	 * To generate the data you can use <a href='http://www.codeandweb.com/texturepacker'>http://www.codeandweb.com/texturepacker</a> and publish in the 'JSON' format
	 * There is a free version so thats nice, although the paid version is great value for money.
	 * It is highly recommended to use Sprite sheets (also know as a 'texture atlas') as it means sprites can be batched and drawn together for highly increased rendering speed.
	 * Once the data has been loaded the frames are stored in the PIXI texture cache and can be accessed though PIXI.Texture.fromFrameId() and PIXI.Sprite.fromFrameId()
	 * This loader will load the image file that the Spritesheet points to as well as the data.
	 * When loaded this class will dispatch a 'loaded' event
